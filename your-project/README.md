## Project Description
Our project is about crimes reported in London. What type of crimes are they? Where do we have the most crimes reported?

## Questions & Hypotheses
We will try to find out what the parts of London with the most collection of crimes. Moreover, we will try to make a corrolation between the average price of rent by area and the criminality in those area.

## Dataset

We used the official API from the UK police department and retrived the necessary information for London area.
We also used data from the government to access to the information about price rents. 
We also a very large set of Data from Kaggle which gives us the crimes per categories whithin the boroughs of London from 2008-2016.

## Database

We have created more than one table however, we analysed the data separately.


## Workflow

The workflow:

- researched for a suitable API for crimes.
- connected the API from the UK police and retrieved data for London.
- downloaded data for rent in London on an official website.
- cleaned the different datas.
- made the analysis of this data by answering to our initial questions.
- created a presentation.


## Organization

We separated the work between ouselves.

Sabbah worked on the Data with the API.
Vladimir worked on the csv file.
Ana worked with tableau and helped Sabbah with the API.

We used trello to organise the work.

In our repo we have all the different files necessary to realise the final presentation.
